      <h2>What happened to Web Rebels 2019?</h2>
      <p>Usually, after wrapping up the conference, we secure our venue for the following year straight away. This time however, we ran into an unexpected challenge: none of the dates available worked for us.</p>
      <p>We went looking for alternatives but ultimately, nothing fit what we were looking for. When you run a conference, you always work within certain constraints, and this time, we couldnâ€™t make it work.</p>
      <p>As a consequence, there will be no Web Rebels in 2019. You may have guessed this already.</p>
      <p>The good news is that we have the dates and the venue we want for 2020.</p>
